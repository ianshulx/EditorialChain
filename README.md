# EditorialChain

**EditorialChain** is an AI-based, streak-focused web platform aimed at helping students and exam aspirants (UPSC, SSC, bank exams, etc.) develop consistent reading habits. The platform tracks users' daily reading streaks and provides personalized recommendations of articles, news, and books based on their interests and reading patterns.

In addition to habit tracking, EditorialChain focuses on improving users' vocabulary, comprehension, and overall knowledge by encouraging daily reading of educational content. It offers AI-driven insights and suggestions to make the reading experience more effective for exam preparation and personal development.

This project is designed to be open-source and is expected to evolve over the course of a year, with development beginning during Hacktoberfest.
